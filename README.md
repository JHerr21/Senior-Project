## Project Overview

### Objective
To develop a system that processes EEG signals, extracts meaningful features, and uses them to control a prosthetic device in real time. This involves simulating and analyzing EEG signals, developing efficient signal processing pipelines, and integrating control algorithms for seamless prosthetic operation.
